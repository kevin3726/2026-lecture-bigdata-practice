"""Week 4 · Task 1 — Answer questions about a stream you cannot store.

Textbook §4.3 (sampling), §4.4 (Bloom filter), §4.5 (Flajolet-Martin).

The premise of the whole chapter: the stream is longer than your memory, it
goes past once, and you still have to answer. Every method here trades an exact
answer for a bounded amount of space, and the job is to know exactly what you
traded.

You build three, and the harness checks each against the truth it is
approximating.

    §4.5. Hash each item, count trailing zeros in the hash, keep the maximum.
    A maximum of R suggests about 2^R distinct items, because seeing R trailing
    zeros is a 1-in-2^R event.

    One hash gives an estimate with enormous variance, so you use many and
    combine them. How you combine them matters a great deal:

      * averaging 2^R directly is dominated by whichever hash got lucky - the
        values are exponential, so one outlier swamps the rest
      * the median is robust but can only ever be a power of two
      * §4.5.3 suggests grouping, and combining twice

    The harness accepts anything **within a factor of two** of the truth. That is
    not a generous tolerance, it is an honest one: this method really is that
    crude, and HyperLogLog exists because of it. Getting inside a factor of two
    reliably is the requirement; getting closer than that is not expected here.
